It's like Spartacus only everyone is claiming to be JavaScript!

## Language Versions

As discussed in a previous session, the current version of browser JS is ECMA5. The next version, predictably, will be ECMA6.

We should code against ECMA5, but be open minded regarding the possiblity of using ECMA6, due to the presence of [BabelJS](babeljs)

[babeljs]: https://babeljs.io/
